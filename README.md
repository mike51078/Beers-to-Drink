### Overview

In this assignment, I created a beer drink logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and an ORM. This assignement required following the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

### Applications/Technologies Used

Listed below are the applications/technologies used in the creation of this application:
* MySQL
* Handlebars
* ORM's
* Heroku
* HTML
* CSS
* CSS Framework/Bootstrap

### Functionality

* Beers to Drink! is an app that lets users input the names of craft beers they'd like to drink.

* Whenever a user submits a beers's name, the app will display the beer on the left side of the page -- waiting to be drank.

* Each beer in the waiting area shows up as a button. When the user clicks it, the beer will move to the right side of the page, allowing the user to keep track of the beers they want to drink and those which they have already had.

### Note

If trying to connect remotely to through the Heroku database on an open network such as a coffee shop, library, or even your University WiFi, it could possibly be blocked. If you are experiencing a Heroku connection error, this could be why.
